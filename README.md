# StudentMentor
### Motivation

My main motivation is doing a web app which I designed from scratch, improving my skills with related to rest api design, database design, authentication and authorization of an applicaiton. For this purpose, I will use **Spring Framework** and **Spring Boot**. Therefore, I will also improve my Spring framework skills. 

Last year, I have participated a side project with friends of mine,
**Codimis**, and have given mentorship to the university students and new starters of software industry.
This app's functional requirements are based on Codimis usage scenarios. I will write a REST API for mentorship project.

Planned technical features for the application are:

-  Swagger documentation for REST API
-  Unit tests and integration tests
-  CI / CD pipeline
-  Accessed from a hosting service
-  Authentication and authorization with JWT
-  Login with Github feature
