# StudentMentor
### Motivation

My motivation is learning **Spring Framework** and **Spring Boot** by doing a tiny real product. Last year, I have participated a side project with friends of mine,
**Codimis**, and have given mentorship to the university students and new starters of software industry.
This app's functional requirements are based on Codimis usage scenarios. I will write a REST API for mentorship project.

Planned technical features for the application are:

-  Swagger documentation for REST API
-  Unit tests and integration tests
-  CI / CD pipeline
-  Accessed from a hosting service
-  Login with Github feature
